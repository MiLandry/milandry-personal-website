This is the code deployed on Netlify implementing https://michaellandry.online/

## Getting Up and Running

`yarn`
`gatsby develop`

then browse to 
http://localhost:8000

## Tests

`no tests`

## Fun facts
Gatsby is pretty fast
uses eslint for linting
Uses exactly one MaterialUI component, with more understanding I could probably leverage that library better (or abandon it)
I am a fan of styled components, this app should use more of it.
